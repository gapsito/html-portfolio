<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Born and raised in the vibrant city of Varna, Bulgaria, 
  my early academic achievements laid the foundation for a career driven by curiosity and a commitment to excellence. 
  Graduating high school with near-perfect marks, I received a special award for achieving 
  the top score in my hometown's Physics national test. My passion for technical subjects led me to studies at the 
  Technical University, though I ultimately chose to pursue a more hands-on, industry-focused path.</p>

  <p>
    For the past 8 years, I've immersed myself in the dynamic world of automotive and battery manufacturing 
    and prototyping, gaining invaluable experience in production optimization, quality control, and team leadership. 
    This experience, combined with my self-directed pursuit of the latest advancements in computer systems and programming, reflects 
    my dedication to continuous learning and growth. I am a person of strong moral principles, and 
    I've worked tirelessly to build a career grounded in integrity and hard work.</p>
  
   <p>
    Beyond my professional pursuits, I am deeply passionate about art and literature, 
    and I find creative expression through sculpture in my free time. I cherish the beauty of 
    the natural world, particularly the landscapes of Lapland, and enjoy outdoor activities such 
    as blueberry picking in the forest. Travel and dogs are also among my greatest passions.</p>
